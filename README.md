# virtual_benchmark_SLAM_3D
Code for datasets creation for testing 3D reconstruction and SLAM algorithms.
The code has been developed in both python and MATLAB, with few differences.

The code has been used extensively to test SLAM and 3D reconstruction algorithms.

If you use this code for your research, please cite the following paper:
"Virtual simulation benchmark for the evaluation of simultaneous localization and mapping and 3D reconstruction algorithm uncertainty"
